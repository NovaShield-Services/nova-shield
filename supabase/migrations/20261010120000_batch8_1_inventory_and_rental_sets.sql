-- Batch 8.1: materials inventory for the lighting services, bulk purchasing,
-- and Christmas rental-set tracking.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- Before this migration the schema knew what a lighting job SELLS
-- (services, pricing_rules.rate, job_measurements.quantity) and nothing at
-- all about what it CONSUMES. Verified live before writing: there is no
-- materials table, no stock level, no supplier, no purchase order, no link
-- from a measurement to a part, and no cost basis anywhere --
-- pricing_rules.rate is a sell price only. So the business could quote
-- 180 linear feet of permanent lighting without the app being able to say
-- whether 180 feet of track was on the shelf.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
--
-- 1. NO CATALOGUE ROWS. The supplier the owner named --
--    https://permanentlightingdirect.ca/diy-kits -- is unreachable from the
--    environment this migration was authored in (DNS failure, then the
--    outbound proxy answered 403 to CONNECT). Part names, SKUs, pack sizes
--    and costs are therefore NOT seeded, because inventing them would put
--    numbers in the database that nobody has ever verified and that would
--    then flow into shortfall maths and purchase orders. The one supplier
--    row below carries only what the owner actually supplied: a name and
--    that URL. Everything else is populated from the admin screen.
--
-- 2. NO MONEY IN THE QUOTE PATH. ns_materials.unit_cost is a COST basis for
--    purchasing and margin review. Nothing in this migration touches
--    calculate_job_pricing, quote_line_items or any customer-facing total.
--    Pricing calculations stay in the existing backend RPCs, unchanged.
--
-- 3. NO MUTABLE on_hand COLUMN. Stock is an append-only ledger
--    (ns_material_stock_moves) summed by a view. A single counter would be
--    cheaper to read and impossible to explain: when the shelf and the app
--    disagree, the question is always "what moved?", which a counter cannot
--    answer and a ledger answers by construction. It also makes a wrong
--    receipt correctable by posting its reverse rather than by overwriting
--    history, which is the same reasoning that keeps pricing_rules
--    effective-dated rather than edited in place.
--
-- SECURITY
--
-- Every table here is admin-only. RLS is enabled with the single `admin_all`
-- policy shape already used across this schema (ALL commands, role
-- authenticated, USING and WITH CHECK both is_admin()), and anon/PUBLIC are
-- revoked explicitly rather than merely left ungranted -- the Batch 7.1
-- finding was that a privilege can arrive three ways (direct, PUBLIC,
-- inherited), so new tables start from an explicit revoke.
--
-- None of this is customer-facing: no policy grants anon any access, and
-- nothing here is read by the public quote page.
