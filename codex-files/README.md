# Codex files — complete Nova Shield handoff

Shared handoff on branch `codex/all-files-handoff`. This branch contains the
Codex application code in its normal repository paths, the revised plans under
`docs/plans/`, and the previously local material collected here. No Claude
branch was merged and no database/deployment action was performed.

## Contents

| Folder/file | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [plans](plans/) | Copies of the revised roadmap, operating blueprint and Claude prompt; maintained originals are in [docs/plans](../docs/plans/README.md) |
| [handoffs](handoffs/) | Mobile reliability, field recovery and native-readiness reports |
| [source](source/) | All 50 files changed by the four Codex implementation commits, captured at d33d17e; application code remains in its normal paths outside this folder |
| [patches](patches/) | Four committed patches, including code and tests, with their commit/parent metadata |
| [artifacts](artifacts/) | Recorded test logs, result JSON and screenshots for 6.2, 7.2 and the earlier 8.2 readiness work |
| [tooling](tooling/README.md) | Portable paths for reproducing the existing browser tests |
| [historical](historical/README.md) | Superseded roadmap, pre-commit handoff/patch and original environment-specific helpers |
| [manifest.json](manifest.json) | SHA-256, byte size, provenance and classification of every imported file |

Archived source snapshots are for inspection, not a second maintained app.
Do not import them into the running application or edit them to implement a new
feature. The root `admin/`, `shared/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` and Android paths
remain the actual source. Future changes should update those canonical paths.

## Implementation commits already pushed

| Work | Commit | Remote branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordered/recoverable measurement entry | f4cdbe552ebd4289920fe533af10371a1d4c7f0d | codex/measurement-reliability |
| Mobile actions/exit and touch reliability | d71f467ca72160092ef3b3ace2e50ae63bd512ee | codex/batch-6-2 |
| Field load recovery and actionable outbox | a8b573f9b9f61b900ede70ff7affd3b04eb67ba9 | codex/batch-7-2 |
| Native packaging audit/accessibility | d33d17ec0b98654e42db1e8adda70580e9931b42 | codex/batch-8-2 |

These form one linear Codex implementation history based on
2cdecc3eed28969a80b2e47d400c35cf18b5125d. The separately pushed roadmap commit
803a37d is also inherited by this handoff branch. Reading a patch is not an
instruction to apply it over Claude's branch. Integration remains separate.

## Evidence and its limits

- Batch 6.2 has 12 individual screenshot views and recorded suite logs. Its
  own new suite is mobile-reliability 22/22; measurement-entry is 29/29.
- Batch 7.2 has 18 individual screenshot views, validation JSON and recorded
  logs. Its new suite is field-resilience 27/27; the handoff records 440 counted
  checks plus geofence.
- Earlier Batch 8.2 readiness work has 18 final individual PNG views and
  `validation.json` recording 474 counted checks plus geofence, including
  native-readiness 24/24 and native-bundle 10/10. Its baseline probes intentionally
  fail the new assertions; they are not passing release runs.
- `artifacts/batch8-2/historical/results.json` is an intermediate run, with
  failures and only 21 readiness checks before the final suite expanded. It
  is superseded by the final validation JSON and final logs.
- The Batch 8.2 contact JPG sheets are in its historical folder: they predate
  the last busy-button CSS correction. Inspect the final individual PNGs.
- Logs are preserved as `.txt` rather than `.log`, because the repository
  ignores scratch log files. Content hashes refer to the original bytes.
- Other baseline/debug/intermediate logs retain their original names; read
  the associated handoff before interpreting a failure as a current defect.
- These are recorded results from those tasks, not a claim that all suites
  were freshly rerun when creating this folder. Browser/API doubles do not
  establish physical Android, live database or production behavior.

The roadmap follows the owner's overall Batch 7 checkpoint, retaining existing
readiness work rather than repeating it. No new inventory feature is implemented
by these documents or archived artifacts.

## Retrieve without changing another agent's working branch

```sh
git fetch origin codex/all-files-handoff
git show FETCH_HEAD:codex-files/README.md
git show FETCH_HEAD:docs/plans/batch-plan-after-7.md
git show FETCH_HEAD:docs/plans/claude-roadmap-handoff.md
git ls-tree -r --name-only FETCH_HEAD codex-files
```

To extract the handoff folder outside the current checkout, choose an empty
destination and use `git archive FETCH_HEAD codex-files`; no branch checkout,
rebase or merge is needed. Do not overwrite the current working tree.

Installed dependencies, caches, credential/auth files, generated native/web
asset copies, unrelated uploads and live data are excluded. Original setup
helpers are retained as historical text, not an instruction to publish local
configuration or reproduce services blindly.
