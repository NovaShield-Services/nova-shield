# Batch 8.1 reconciled against the revised roadmap

Branch `claude/batch-8-1`. Written after reading, read-only, from
`origin/codex/roadmap-after-batch-7`:

* `docs/plans/batch-plan-after-7.md`
* `docs/plans/claude-roadmap-handoff.md`
* `docs/plans/service-operations-blueprint.md`

Nothing was merged and no branch was switched. The roadmap documents are
authoritative; where this reconciliation and the shipped code disagree, the
documents win.

## 1. Starting state, measured

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| My branch | `claude/batch-8-1` |
| Base | `b21cb41` (Batch 7.1 follow-up) |
| Batch 8.1 commit | `ea91466` |
| Codex's native-readiness work | `d33d17e`, **not an ancestor of my branch** |
| Codex's measurement work | `f4cdbe5`, `d71f467`, also not ancestors |
| Roadmap branch | `origin/codex/roadmap-after-batch-7`, fetched, not merged |

The plan cites Claude's 7.1 work at `7a2f2af`. That is accurate but
incomplete: `7a2f2af` was followed by `b21cb41`, the safety and portability
follow-up (disposable-database guard, all three privilege routes, bare `pg`
specifier). `b21cb41` is the real 7.1 tip and the base for 8.1.

All release items the plan lists as outstanding remain outstanding. Nothing
has been applied, cleaned, merged or deployed:

* `20261009160000_batch5_freeze_customer_facing_content_once_sent.sql`
* `20261010090000_batch7_1_tighten_remaining_admin_rpc_grants.sql`
* `20261010091000_batch7_1_revoke_anon_writes_on_legacy_tables.sql`
* `20261010120000_batch8_1_inventory_and_rental_sets.sql`
* `20261010121000_batch8_1_estimate_job_materials.sql`
* The 7.1 §5 data-quality questions, and the unidentified legacy inbound FK.
* The repository still has **no base schema** (7.1 finding 4b). Recorded as a
  gap, per the handoff's instruction not to build a fake production baseline.

## 2. File-boundary violations in `ea91466`, and the reverts

The plan's ownership table assigns four files I edited to the other track or
to integration. All four are reverted to their `b21cb41` state in the commit
that carries this document.

| File | Plan says | What `ea91466` did | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| `admin/js/main.js` | Codex; route wiring at integration | added the `#/inventory` route + import | reverted |
| `admin/index.html` | nav belongs with route registration | added the Inventory nav link | reverted |
| `package.json` | Codex owns manifests/lockfiles | changed the `test:db` script | reverted |
| `tests/run-regression.sh` | separate owner-authorised integration change | registered phase22 + phase23 | reverted |
| `shared/dom.js` | read-only unless explicitly transferred | added `fill()` | moved out |

`fill()` now lives in `admin/js/lib/admin-dom.js`, inside my own track, and
`inventory.js` / `job-materials.js` import it from there. It is not
inventory-specific; if the field track needs the same helper, the right move
is an owner-authorised transfer into `shared/`, not a second copy.

`admin/css/admin.css` was **not** edited — the overflow fix was done with
inline styles on my own elements. The plan permits a narrowly scoped admin
operations stylesheet for exactly this; that is the proper home and is listed
below as corrective work rather than churned now.

### Consequences of the reverts, stated plainly

* The Inventory screen is **not reachable from the admin console**. It is
  tested standalone, which is what the plan prescribes. Route and nav wiring
  are integration items.
* `npm test` is back to **24 suites** and no longer covers Batch 6.1 Settings
  (`phase22`) or Batch 8.1 Inventory (`phase23`). Both pass; run them directly
  until integration registers them.
* `npm run test:db` still points at the Batch 7.1 suite alone, so it silently
  skips the 8.1 database suite. Use `bash tests/db/run-db-tests.sh`, which
  runs both against a freshly created disposable database.
  `tests/db/setup-test-db.mjs` now prints that path and says why.

### Hand to integration

1. `tests/run-regression.sh`: add `phase22` and `phase23` to the explicit
   list. Keep it explicit — never a glob over `tests/*.test.mjs`, because
   `tests/db/` and `tests/integration/` talk to real databases. Codex's
   `native-bundle` and `native-readiness` suites need registering too.
2. `package.json`: `"test:db": "bash tests/db/run-db-tests.sh"`.
3. `admin/js/main.js` + `admin/index.html`: the `#/inventory` route and nav
   entry. The view's entry point is
   `renderInventory({ mount, params, replaceQuery, navigate })`.

## 3. What `ea91466` actually is, against the plan's 8.1

The plan's 8.1 is *stock foundation, units and minimal crew access*. What
shipped is a **partial 8.1 plus part of 9.1**. Honest assessment below.

### Delivered and keeps

* An additive catalogue (`ns_materials`) with suppliers, pack/unit conversion
  (`pack_quantity`), supplier references, and no invented rows.
* An **append-only movement ledger** (`ns_material_stock_moves`) with an
  on-hand view derived from it, rather than a mutable counter. This matches
  the plan's "append-only stock movement rules" and its insistence that
  corrections preserve history: a mistake is corrected by posting its reverse.
* Receipts via purchase orders counted in **packs**, converted to operating
  units exactly once on receipt.
* A sign/reason agreement constraint, so a receipt cannot be posted negative
  and a consumption cannot be posted positive.
* Service → material consumption mapping with a bounded waste factor, and
  `estimate_job_materials` deriving a job's requirement from measurements
  that already exist.
* RLS, explicit revokes from PUBLIC and anon, a `security_invoker` view.
* 70 database checks on a disposable PostgreSQL, 48 mocked browser checks.

### Missing, and required for the plan's 8.1 acceptance

1. **Stock locations.** The single largest gap. `ns_material_stock_moves` has
   one global balance. The plan requires **Base, Car A and optional Car B**
   with distinct balances over one shared base pool. Every acceptance
   criterion about transfers depends on this.
2. **Transfers.** No location-to-location movement, therefore nothing to
   satisfy "transfers conserve totals" or "confirm physical movement before
   stock moves".
3. **Reservations and releases.** Nothing prevents "both crews reserving the
   same scarce stock". Not modelled at all.
4. **Operations-contract v1.** Absent entirely: no replay/idempotency ID, no
   actor or vehicle attribution, no record version, no pending/conflict
   response shape. "A replay cannot add stock twice" currently fails.
5. **Crew permissions.** Only `is_admin()`. The plan requires owner versus
   assigned-crew, and "crew cannot read or alter unassigned records".
6. **Units.** Shipped: each, linear_ft, box, roll, kit, set. Required and
   missing: **litres** (bleach, degreaser, rust remover, Gutter Bomb, Dawn),
   **kilograms** (solid de-icer), channel by **stick/profile** with usable
   offcuts, strings by **specified length and type**, and a Low/Enough/Empty
   replenishment level for cheap supplies.
7. **Exact versus estimated counting**, and **usable versus damaged** stock.
   The plan is explicit that approximate quantities must never be presented
   as exact balances; nothing in the current schema can express the
   difference.
8. **Opening balances as explicit entries.** The `opening` reason exists, but
   nothing states or enforces that balances are never inferred from old
   quotes.
9. **Second supplier.** `https://lightsdepot.ca/` (Christmas) is not
   represented. Only `permanentlightingdirect.ca/diy-kits` was seeded.
10. **Sealed kit versus components.** The invariant "a kit counts as a sealed
    kit OR its unpacked components, never both" is 9.1 work, but the 8.1
    schema has no place to hold the distinction, so 9.1 cannot enforce it
    without a migration that reshapes 8.1's tables.

### Shipped early, belongs to a later batch

* `ns_rental_sets` / `ns_rental_set_events` are **9.1**, not 8.1. They are
  also shaped wrong for what 9.1 requires: the plan wants a set/run identity
  **independent of the customer**, with temporary assignment, run
  length/type/colour, bins and storage locations, condition, and an
  owner-set release cutoff. The shipped table keys identity to a `set_code`
  with a direct `customer_id` and a status vocabulary that conflates
  assignment with location. 9.1 will restructure it. The lifecycle event log
  is the part most likely to survive unchanged.
* The per-job Materials panel (`admin/js/components/job-materials.js`) is
  closer to 10.1 load planning than to 8.1. It is harmless, within my
  ownership and useful, so it stays, but it is not 8.1 evidence.

### Already consistent with the plan

* Pricing stays in backend RPCs; nothing in 8.1 touches
  `calculate_job_pricing`, `quote_line_items`, `get_customer_quote`,
  `mark_quote_sent`, `respond_to_quote` or `pricing_rules`, and a test greps
  both migrations to keep it that way.
* No parallel inventory per service — one catalogue, shared across the nine
  cleaning services.
* No parallel sender or outbox.
* No fabricated supplier data. The plan records that Codex's proxy hit
  HTTP 403 on both supplier sites; mine fails the same way
  (`getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND`, then `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`), so
  pack sizes and kit contents stay unset and configurable.
* Existing customers, properties, jobs, quote snapshots, guards, rollups and
  the notification worker are untouched.

## 4. Corrective 8.1 work, in order

Proposed, not started. Each item is testable on a disposable database.

1. **Locations and balances.** `ns_stock_locations` (Base, Car A, optional
   Car B), `location_id` on every movement, on-hand per material per
   location, with the base pool shared.
2. **Transfers as a conserving pair.** One operation, two movements, one
   transaction, with a database-level proof that totals are conserved.
   Physical-movement confirmation recorded on the operation, not inferred.
3. **Operations-contract v1.** `client_operation_id` unique per operation for
   replay safety; `actor_id` and `vehicle_id`; `record_version` for optimistic
   concurrency; a defined pending/conflict response shape. Freeze the snapshot
   and hand the identical copy to the field track, so neither side invents a
   counterpart.
4. **Reservations and releases**, with a constraint that makes a second
   reservation against the same scarce stock impossible rather than unlikely.
5. **Crew permissions.** Owner versus assigned crew, enforced in RLS, with a
   test that a crew cannot read or alter unassigned records.
6. **Units.** Add L, kg, stick, and a replenishment-level unit; add
   exact-versus-estimated and usable-versus-damaged.
7. **Admin operations view**, replacing the standalone Inventory screen's
   scope with catalogue / receive / transfer, using existing CSS primitives
   plus a narrowly scoped `admin/css/admin-operations.css` limited to
   management-view selectors — which is also where the `.section-box__head`
   wrap fix belongs instead of the current inline styles.
8. **Second supplier row** for `lightsdepot.ca`, name and URL only.

Items 1–3 are prerequisites for the plan's acceptance criteria; 4–6 complete
them; 7–8 are presentation and data entry.

## 5. Correctness questions that affect the work

Only the ones that change what gets built. Everything else I will decide and
record.

1. **Does an unreserved balance exist?** When Car A holds stock that no job
   has reserved, is it available to Car B's planning, or is anything on a
   vehicle committed to that vehicle until returned? This decides whether
   reservations are against a global pool or a per-location one, and it is
   not answerable from the documents.
2. **Who may correct whom?** "Attributed corrections" is clear, but not
   whether a crew may correct its own count or only the owner may. This
   decides an RLS policy, not a UI affordance.
3. **Is Car B's existence configuration or data?** A row in
   `ns_stock_locations` that may be absent, or a fixed two-location model with
   Car B inactive. The plan says "optional Car B"; both readings satisfy it,
   and they differ in how a second crew is enabled later.

I am proceeding on these defaults and will mark each in the schema comments:
(1) stock on a vehicle is available to that vehicle's planning only, and is
returned to Base to become generally available — the conservative reading,
since the alternative lets two crews plan against metal that is physically in
one car; (2) a crew may post a correction attributed to itself but may not
alter another actor's movement; (3) Car B is a row that may be absent, so
enabling a second crew is data entry rather than a migration.
