/* Android-correct back navigation for a hash-routed SPA.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * This app ships as a Capacitor Android app. Until now nothing listened for
 * the hardware/gesture Back at all, so Back fell through to the WebView's
 * raw history. That is wrong in three specific ways:
 *
 *   1. A deep link (notification, or the app resuming on an inner screen)
 *      starts with a history length of 1. Back then has nowhere to go and
 *      the app EXITS from an inner screen -- the single most jarring
 *      Android bug an app can have.
 *   2. A full-screen overlay (photo markup) is not a history entry, so Back
 *      navigated the screen out from underneath it and left the overlay
 *      orphaned on top of the new screen.
 *   3. Raw history.back() walks whatever happens to be in the stack,
 *      including entries pushed by things that are not screens.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE FIX
 *
 * decideBack() is a pure function: given what is on screen, it returns the
 * single action to take. Everything that is hard to get right lives there,
 * so it can be unit-tested exhaustively with no device and no WebView.
 * installBackHandler() is the thin, untestable-by-nature binding that reads
 * the live DOM, calls decideBack(), and performs the action.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HANDLED HERE
 *
 * window.confirm() dialogs. The app confirms destructive actions through
 * shared/dom.js's confirmAction(), which is a native WebView dialog that
 * blocks the JS thread -- our listener cannot run while one is open, and
 * the WebView dismisses it on Back itself. Nothing to do, and attempting to
 * track them would be pretending to a control we do not have.

   installEscapeHandler() below reuses it. */

/** What a single Back press should do. Pure.
 *
 *  Precedence, highest first -- each step is something the user is more
 *  likely to have meant than the step below it:
 *
 *    1. a full-screen overlay is up        -> close it
 *    2. the nav drawer is open             -> close it
 *    3. the soft keyboard is up            -> dismiss it
 *    4. history has a same-app entry       -> go back one entry
 *    5. an inner screen with no history    -> go to the logical parent
 *    6. the root with no history           -> leave the app
 *
 *  Note that step 4 comes BEFORE the root check, which is Android's real
 *  rule: what ends the app is an EMPTY BACK STACK, not "being on the home
 *  screen". A user who walks dashboard -> jobs -> dashboard is on the root
 *  with two entries behind them and expects Back to return to jobs. Testing
 *  for the root first (as the first draft of this function did) quit the app
 *  there and threw away their place.
 *
 *  On step 3: on Android the system normally consumes Back to hide the
 *  keyboard before the WebView ever sees it, so this branch is defensive
 *  rather than the usual path. It is gated on evidence that the keyboard is
 *  actually up (a shrunken visual viewport), NOT merely on an input having
 *  focus -- a focused input with the keyboard already down must not swallow
 *  a Back press, which would make Back feel broken.
 *
 *  On step 4 vs 5: canGoBack is "is there an entry belonging to this app",
 *  which the caller derives from its own navigation count, not from
 *  history.length -- history.length includes entries from before the app
 *  loaded and going back into those leaves the app's shell behind. */
