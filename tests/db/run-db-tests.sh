# Runs every disposable-database suite, each against a FRESH database.
#
#   npm run test:db
#
# Why re-create the database between suites rather than run them back to
# back: each suite installs its own fixture schema, and the two fixtures
# define overlapping table names with different shapes (Batch 7.1 needs the
# legacy jobs/quotes tables and a cut-down ns_quotes; Batch 8.1 needs
# ns_jobs, services and job_measurements). Sharing one database would make
# the result depend on the order they ran in, which is the kind of
# cross-contamination these suites exist to rule out.
#
# Every suite refuses to run against anything but the dedicated disposable
# database -- see tests/db/disposable.mjs. Override the target with PGURL
# and the maintenance connection with PGADMIN_URL.
